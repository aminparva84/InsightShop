## How It Works

1. **Automatic Detection**: The AI automatically detects when you're asking fashion-related questions
2. **Knowledge Base**: It uses a comprehensive fashion knowledge base that includes:
   - Color matching rules (complementary, analogous, monochromatic)
   - Occasion-appropriate styling
   - Fabric characteristics and care
   - Dress styles and necklines
   - Men's and women's style guides
3. **Contextual Responses**: The AI provides detailed, helpful advice based on your question

## Example Interactions

### Example 1: Color Matching
**You**: "What colors go with red?"

**AI**: "Red is such a bold, confident color! Here are some amazing color combinations:

- **Classic**: Red pairs beautifully with navy, white, black, and gray for timeless looks
- **Bold**: Red and green are complementary colors (opposites on the color wheel) - use sparingly for statement pieces
- **Elegant**: Red with beige or camel creates a sophisticated, warm look
- **Modern**: Red with pink or coral creates a vibrant, feminine palette

For a red shirt, you could pair it with navy chinos and white sneakers for a classic look, or with black jeans and a leather jacket for an edgier vibe!"

### Example 2: Occasion Advice
**You**: "What should I wear to a wedding?"

**AI**: "For a wedding, you want to look polished and appropriate! Here's what works:

**For Women:**
- Elegant dress (knee-length or longer)
- Blazer or tailored jacket
- Closed-toe heels
- Minimal, elegant accessories

**For Men:**
- Suit or dress shirt with blazer
- Dress pants or chinos
- Dress shoes
- Tie (optional, depending on formality)

**Colors**: Navy, black, gray, or elegant pastels work well. Avoid white (reserved for the bride) and overly bright colors that might upstage the couple!"

### Example 3: Fabric Information
**You**: "Tell me about cotton fabric"

**AI**: "Cotton is one of the most popular and versatile fabrics! Here's why it's great:

**Characteristics:**
- Super breathable - perfect for hot weather
- Soft and comfortable against the skin
- Durable and long-lasting
- Easy to care for (machine washable)
- Absorbs moisture well

**Best For:**
- T-shirts, casual shirts, summer clothing
- Everyday wear
- People with sensitive skin
- Hot climates

**Care Tips:**
- Machine wash in cold or warm water
- Can shrink slightly, so check sizing
- Tumble dry on low or air dry
- Iron on medium heat if needed"

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Specific**: The more specific your question, the better the advice
   - ✅ "What colors go with a navy blue blazer?"
   - ❌ "What matches?"

2. **Mention Context**: Include the occasion or situation
   - ✅ "What should I wear to a business meeting?"
   - ❌ "What should I wear?"

3. **Ask Follow-ups**: The AI remembers context, so you can ask follow-up questions
   - "What colors go with red?"
   - "What about for a casual look?"
   - "What fabrics work best?"

## Integration with Product Search

Fashion Match works seamlessly with product search:

1. **Ask for fashion advice** → Get styling recommendations
2. **Ask to see products** → Get matching products from the store
3. **Combine both** → "Show me red shirts that go with navy pants"

Example:
- **You**: "What colors go with red? Show me some red t-shirts"
- **AI**: Provides color matching advice AND shows you red t-shirts from the store!

## Behind the Scenes

The Fashion Match feature uses:
- **Color Theory**: Complementary, analogous, and monochromatic color schemes
- **Fashion Knowledge Base**: Comprehensive database of styling rules and advice
- **Occasion Guidelines**: Appropriate dressing for different events
- **Fabric Expertise**: Characteristics and care instructions for different materials

All of this is automatically available - just ask!
